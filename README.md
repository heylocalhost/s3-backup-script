Automated Backup Script
Overview
This project is a Python-based automated backup script designed to regularly back up important development files or directories to both a local backup location and an Amazon S3 bucket. The script is intended to be run daily at 11:45 PM IST via a cron job, ensuring that your important files are securely backed up on a consistent basis.

Features
Automated Backups: Schedule backups to run daily at a specific time.
S3 Integration: Securely upload backups to an Amazon S3 bucket.
Local Backup Option: Optionally store backups locally in addition to S3.
Logging: Detailed logs are maintained for each backup operation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x: Installed on your system.

AWS Account: With access to an S3 bucket.

boto3 Library: AWS SDK for Python.

Install boto3 using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install boto3
Setup
Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backup-script.git
cd backup-script
Configuration

The script uses a config.json file to specify directories for backup, the S3 bucket details, and backup schedules. Sensitive information such as AWS credentials should not be stored directly in this file.

Step 1: Modify the config/config.json file to specify your source directories, S3 bucket name, and S3 folder path.

Example:

json
Copy code
{
    "source_directories": [
        "/path/to/development/folder1",
        "/path/to/development/folder2"
    ],
    "backup_destination": "/path/to/local/backup/location",  // Optional
    "s3_bucket_name": "your-s3-bucket-name",
    "s3_backup_folder": "your/s3/folder/path"
}
Step 2: Create a .env file in the project root to store your sensitive credentials. Do not commit this file to version control.

File: .env

plaintext
Copy code
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
Step 3: Install the python-dotenv library to load environment variables from the .env file (if not already installed).

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv
Usage
Run Manually

You can run the script manually to test if the backup works correctly:

bash
Copy code
python3 src/backup_script.py
Setup Cron Job

To automate the backup, set up a cron job to run the script daily at 11:45 PM IST.

Open the crontab editor:

bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add the following line to schedule the backup:

bash
Copy code
15 18 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/src/backup_script.py
This cron job will execute the script every day at 11:45 PM IST (18:15 UTC).

Logs
The script maintains a log file at logs/backup.log that records each backup operation, including any errors or warnings.

Security Considerations
Sensitive Information: Ensure that your AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are stored securely in environment variables or a .env file. Do not commit these credentials to your version control system.
.gitignore: The .env file and any other sensitive configuration files should be added to .gitignore to prevent them from being accidentally pushed to a remote repository.
Example .gitignore
plaintext
Copy code
# Ignore .env file containing sensitive credentials
.env

# Ignore config.json if it contains sensitive data
config/config.json

# Ignore logs
logs/backup.log
